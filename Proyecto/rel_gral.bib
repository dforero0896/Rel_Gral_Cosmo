abstract = {I describe how relativistic field theory generalises the defining prop-erty of material systems to possess mass to the requirement of them having a mass-energy-momentum density tensor T µ$\nu$ (energy tensor for short) associated with them. I argue that according to general relativity T µ$\nu$ is not an intrinsic property of matter, looking at how the energy tensor for a relativistic material system can be derived in a Lagrangian framework. It will become evident that the matter fields $\Phi$ alone are not sufficient for such a derivation. The metric field g µ$\nu$ plays a prominent role in obtaining the energy tensor of a material system, and occurs explicitly in a generic T µ$\nu$ . Accordingly, since g µ$\nu$ represents the geometry of spacetime itself, the properties of mass, stress, energy and momentum should not be seen as intrinsic proper-ties of matter, but as relational properties that material systems have only in virtue of their relation to spacetime structure.},
